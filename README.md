# decision_trees_random_forests

## ðŸ“Œ Objective
This task focuses on learning tree-based machine learning models â€” **Decision Tree** and **Random Forest** â€” for classification using the **Heart Disease Dataset**. The goal is to train, visualize, evaluate, and compare models while understanding concepts like overfitting, feature importance, and cross-validation.

## ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Graphviz / plot_tree for visualization

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
**Dataset Used:** [Heart Disease Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset)

This dataset contains medical information about patients, including age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc., to predict the presence of heart disease (`target` column).

## ðŸ§ª Steps Performed

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Loaded and explored the dataset
- Checked for missing values (none found)
- Split data into features and target

### 2. Model Training â€“ Decision Tree
- Trained a default `DecisionTreeClassifier`
- Visualized the tree using `plot_tree`
- Evaluated using accuracy and confusion matrix

### 3. Overfitting Control
- Restricted tree depth using `max_depth=4`
- Compared accuracy and visualized the pruned tree

### 4. Model Training â€“ Random Forest
- Trained a `RandomForestClassifier` with 100 trees
- Compared performance with the decision tree
- Evaluated accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

### 5. Feature Importance
- Extracted and plotted feature importances from the random forest model

### 6. Cross-Validation
- Performed 5-fold cross-validation
- Compared the stability and average accuracy of both models
